# My dotfiles!

So this is my setup that I intend to reuse through all my systems. It should install all main software for daily development.

### How to use

- `git clone` this repository, if you are on a fresh installation of MacOS, running any `git` command will trigger the "xcode-commandline-tools" installation prompt. It contains git.
- Run `./install.sh`, all should be ok!
